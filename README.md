# Coronary Artery Disease SVM
Coronary artery disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide and requires accurate and timely diagnosis for effective intervention. In this study, the performance of the machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), has been compared in the field of coronary artery disease detection. SVM is a classic machine learning technique widely used for classification tasks. Ultimately, the performance, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of SVM are analyzed and compared.
